Hello dear friends and possible employers,

this is a project I started during my re-education as a software engineer. It is based on programming exercises my Python teacher Tankred gave us.

Important: 
This is a work in progress! 

It works as it is right now, but I want to add a lot more when I find the time.

Next step:
Access modifiers and (more/proper) getter/setter methods

Have a nice day!
Christian
